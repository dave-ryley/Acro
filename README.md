# Snow Fight

Snow Fight was developed using Unreal Engine 4.20 and uses 3rd party Libraries GorbComponent and RuntimeMeshComponent. The project examined the use of Runtime Mesh generation as a gameplay mechanic, and how meshes generated with a low polygon count could be complimented with Fragment Shaders (Using Unreal Engine's Material Graph) to create the appearance of higher quality geometry. 

The game created is a platformer that utilized 2D mechanics mapped to a fixed, wrapping circumference in 3D space. The game utilizes session-based multiplayer using the Steam Online Subsystem.
